## User Experience (UX)

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   There are five colours used throughout the site, the first three are main colours and the remaining two are used for accents.
                ![Coolors rendering of colour scheme](/workspace/full-template/assets/images/rtbcolourscheme.png)
            The colours #0F306E, #5982DE and F80905 were chosen as they approach the palette of the decals on the 1988 Honda Transalp 600, an iconic enduro motorcycle. The colour #D4AF37 was chosen as an accent colour as it resembles the colour of many motorcycle brake calipers. Finally, #D8F4FB was added as a transition colour to soften the vibrant palette where needed. 
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Domine font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Fira Sans, Raleway and ultimately Sans Serif as the fallback fonts in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Domine is a serif font which was designed for body text on the web and is friendly on the eyes.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is important. The large, background hero image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. It puts the user in the position of a biker in the driver's seat. The three images used in the Explore, Connect and Inspire sections of the Home page capture the gist of the text. The image at the top of the Routes page represents the sense of adventure and freedom typically associated with riding a motorcycle.

## Features

### Existing features

#### Features across all pages

-   Navigation bar which remains fixed at the top of the page. It makes for easy and consistent navigation throughout the site. The current page is highlighted dark.

-   Footer which appears on every page and stays at the bottom. The footer contains the statement that this website is for educational purposes only.

-   Newsletter sign-up button is located in middle of the footer on every page. The colours on the button are inverted when the user hovers over it. When selected, a modal pop-up appears allowing the user to submit their email address.

#### Page specific features

##### Home page

-   Scrolling mouse wheel animation to direct the user to scroll down to the content initially hidden from view by the hero image.

-   Content section containing three cards with statement headings and minimal text aimed to elicit an emotional response. The text is flanked by images to match the message. The text is followed by a call to action button which reiterates the statement heading and when selected lands the user on the appropriate page on the website.  

##### Routes page

-   Heading image which conveys the sense of adventure and freedom typically associated with riding a motorcycle. The image is deliberately not full-width nor full view height so as not to obscure the content section or require a scroll invitation.
